Organization Pull Request Manager
=================

Lets you see pull requests across an entire organization.  Helpful if you manage a vast amount of grouped repositories.

The code is a bit sloppy cause I threw it together for personal use, but figured others could use something similar.


## Usage

Edit index.html and set the 'user' variable to the Organization you wish to track (I know, bad names).  If you need to track private repos, setup a Personal Access Token in your git account and add that as well.
